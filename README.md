# US_Airline_Sentiment_Analysis_using_Twitter_Data
Sentiment Analysis, feature creation(TF, TF-IDF), machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, logistic regression, SVM)

1. Introduction

Sentiment analysis started in early 2000s. Multiple approaches have been developed and a lot of research has been done in various fields afterwards. But only a few studies directly focused on the area of airlines based on Twitter data. Hence, the main purpose of this project is to provide a sentiment classification baseline in the area of US airline service using Twitter data.

2. Challenges

The challenges of this project are associated with Twitter data. First, the service-related data from Twitter is often unbalanced. There are way more negative Tweets than positive and neutral Tweets, which makes sense because people who has an awful experience is more likely to share that experience on Twitter. The unbalanced data might have an impact on sentiment classification. Second, unlike formal publications, Tweets require extra text clean and normalization before feeding them to machine learning classifiers. This is because Tweets are often incomplete, not bound to strict grammar rules and they include a lot of irrelevant information, such as user mentions, hashtags and URL links.
